1. Innovative Software Project

Project Name

ContextPilot

One-line Description

An AI-powered personal context engine that automatically builds and maintains a structured “memory” of a user’s projects, decisions, preferences, and knowledge—then injects the right context into future AI prompts, emails, documents, or code tasks.

Why It’s Innovative

Most AI tools forget context or rely on users to re-explain things. ContextPilot:
	•	Continuously extracts, organizes, and versions context
	•	Detects what context is relevant for a new task
	•	Generates optimized prompts automatically
	•	Works across tools (ChatGPT, IDEs, email, docs)

This turns AI from “stateless assistant” into a context-aware collaborator.

2. High-Level Plan (How to Build It)

Phase 1 – Core MVP (2–4 weeks)

Goal: Prove value with minimal surface area.

Features
	•	Store “context units” (facts, decisions, preferences)
	•	Tag and version them
	•	Generate a contextualized prompt from a user task
	•	Simple UI (web)

Deliverables
	•	Context storage engine
	•	Prompt composer
	•	Web UI

⸻

Phase 2 – Intelligence Layer (4–6 weeks)

Goal: Make it smart, not just stored.

Features
	•	Automatic context extraction from text
	•	Relevance scoring (what context matters now)
	•	Conflict detection (outdated vs current context)
	•	Context decay (old info fades unless reinforced)

⸻

Phase 3 – Integrations (optional)

Goal: Make it useful daily.

Integrations
	•	Browser extension
	•	IDE plugin
	•	ChatGPT / API prompt injector
	•	Notion / Markdown import

  "type": "preference | decision | fact | goal",
  "content": "User prefers concise technical explanations",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "last_used": "timestamp",
  "source": "manual | extracted",
  "tags": ["communication", "style"],
  "status": "active | superseded"
}

3.3 Tech Stack (Recommended)

Frontend
	•	React + TypeScript
	•	Tailwind or minimal UI kit

Backend
	•	FastAPI or Node.js (NestJS)
	•	REST + optional GraphQL

AI Layer
	•	LLM API (OpenAI / local)
	•	Embeddings for similarity search

Storage
	•	PostgreSQL (structured data)
	•	Vector DB (pgvector / Pinecone / Weaviate)

4. Prompt for an AI Programming Agent

This is the copy-paste prompt you can use with an AI coding agent (Cursor, Devin-like agent, GPT-based coder, etc.).

AI Programming Agent Prompt

You are a senior software engineer and AI architect.

Your task is to design and implement an MVP of a software system called "ContextPilot".

Goal:
ContextPilot is an AI-powered personal context engine that stores structured user context (preferences, decisions, goals, facts) and automatically injects the most relevant context into future AI prompts.

Functional Requirements:
1. Allow creating, updating, and listing ContextUnits.
2. ContextUnits must support:
   - type (preference, decision, fact, goal)
   - content (natural language)
   - tags
   - confidence score
   - versioning / superseded status
3. Implement a relevance engine:
   - Given a user task, rank stored ContextUnits by relevance
   - Use embeddings or keyword similarity
4. Implement a prompt composer:
   - Combine the user task with the top relevant ContextUnits
   - Output a clean, optimized prompt for an LLM
5. Provide a minimal web UI:
   - Add/edit context
   - Enter a task
   - View generated prompt

Technical Constraints:
- Backend: FastAPI or Node.js
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Use a vector database or embedding-based similarity
- Write clean, modular, testable code
- Include a README with setup instructions

Non-Goals:
- No authentication
- No billing
- No heavy UI design

Deliverables:
- Full source code
- Clear folder structure
- Example data
- Example generated prompt

Think step by step.
Start with architecture.
Then implement backend.
Then frontend.
Then connect everything.
